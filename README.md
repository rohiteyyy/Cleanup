# cleanup
For people who can't be bothered to delete their temp files on the regular (Windows only) 
  
To use, browse to the folder and open command prompt to  
<code>pip install pyqt5</code>  <br>
<code>python cleanup.py</code>  
  
Incase files aren't being deleted or directories aren't recognised (admin issues), run  
<code>cleancache</code>  (#self elevating shell script)  
  
For more convenient use, use pyinstaller and convert to an executable after running it once (data.txt created where your directories are stored)
